# bitcoind build using npm
-----------------

## Why

- I am currently working on blockchain [project](https://github.com/dev-usertoken/virtual-machine) that is based on NODEJS and NPM so, I did not
  want to change the tooling to keep devops simple.

## build : output in ./bin/bitcoind ./bin/bitcoin-cli ./bin/bitcoin-tx
```
  npm start
```
